      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there, I’m Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts and
        the world’s most enthusiastic creature lover. I’ve got a knack for
        befriending all sorts of magical beasties—from Hippogriffs to
        dragons—though, let’s be honest, not all of them are as friendly as I
        am! My life’s a bit like a giant-sized adventure book—full of exciting
        escapades, oversized tea mugs, and a lot of muddy boots. I’m a bit rough
        around the edges, but if you ever need a big heart and an even bigger
        bear hug, I’m your giant. Just don’t be surprised if my giant spider
        friends decide to drop by for tea!

        In this charming headshot, we have Hagrid, looking like he just
        discovered a new breed of magical creature in his beard. His wild,
        untamed hair and beard seem to have a life of their own, possibly hiding
        a small forest within. With twinkling eyes and a mischievous grin, he
        looks like he’s about to reveal the secret recipe for rock cakes that
        are only slightly less dangerous than the ones he usually makes. It’s
        the kind of face that says, “I might be rough around the edges, but I
        give the best hugs and have the most fascinating pets.”
